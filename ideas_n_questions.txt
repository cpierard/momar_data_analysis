Here we write the questions that we try to explore with the mooring data.

Let's number the NB like: 01.TP_stock.ipynb

so we can point the questions to the corresponding notebook like in this example:

-[01] Explore the dynamics of toilet paper stocks. 

QUESTIONS AND IDEAS

-[] Statistics of Temperarture Profiles (RBR and SBE).
-[] Statistics of speed and direction near the bottom (Aquadopp).
-[] SBE exploration? Compute densities and explore salinty?	
-[] Is there a mean warming or cooling at certain layers?
-[] Detect mixing or near mixing events, where temperature gradients are negative or close to zero.
-[] What is the vertical extension of seasonality?
-[] Can we detect passing Meddies (900m - 1000m)?
